Author/s: Yeohan Norona, Vincent Bacayan, Glena Estebal

A student-project case study on a dataset from a 2014 survey conducted by a non-profit corporation called Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.


After cleaning the dataset and analyzing the variables of the dataset, the EDA questions formulated:

- How many respondents who work remotely and are diagnosed with mental health conditions have had their mental health condition interfere with work?

- What is the frequency in observing negative consequences from coworkers who have mental health conditions between the different size of companies or organizations (6-25 employees, More than 1000 employees, 26-100 employees, 100-500 employees, 1-5 employees, 500-1000 employees)?

- How many respondents feel that it is easy to take medical leave for a mental health condition if their employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?

- Which among the size of companies or organizations (6-25 employees, More than 1000 employees, 26-100 employees, 100-500 employees, 1-5 employees, 500-1000 employees) has the highest frequency in terms of willingness to discuss a mental health issue with coworkers?

- What is the average age of employees who said yes in being willing to discuss a mental health issue with coworkers and the average age of employees who said no?
